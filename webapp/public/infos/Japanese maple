<h3>Description</h3>
<div>Coloured leaves of a Japanese Maple (Nison-in), Kyoto</div>

<div>Acer palmatum is a deciduous shrub or small tree reaching heights of 6 to 10 m (20 to 33 ft), rarely 16 metres (52 ft), often growing as an understory plant in shady woodlands. It may have multiple trunks joining close to the ground. In habit, it is often shaped like a hemisphere (especially when younger) or takes on a dome-like form, especially when mature.[3] The leaves are 4–12 cm long and wide, palmately lobed with five, seven, or nine acutely pointed lobes. The flowers are produced in small cymes, the individual flowers with five red or purple sepals and five whitish petals. The fruit is a pair of winged samaras, each samara 2–3 cm long with a 6–8 mm seed. The seeds of Japanese maple and similar species require stratification in order to germinate.[3][4]</div>

<div>Even in nature, Acer palmatum displays considerable genetic variation, with seedlings from the same parent tree typically showing differences in such traits as leaf size, shape, and colour.[3]</div>

<h3>Cultivation and uses</h3>
<div>This Japanese Maple shows a dome-like shape.</div>

<div>Japanese Maple has been cultivated in Japan for centuries and in temperate areas around the world since the 1800s.[3] The first specimen of the tree reached England in 1820.</div>

<div>When Swedish doctor-botanist Carl Peter Thunberg traveled in Japan late in the eighteenth century, he secreted out drawings of a small tree that would eventually become synonymous with the high art of oriental gardens.[5] He gave it the species name palmatum after the hand-like shape of its leaves, similar to the centuries old Japanese names kaede and momiji, references to the 'hands' of frogs[6] and babies,[citation needed] respectively.</div>

<div>For centuries Japanese horticulturalists have developed cultivars from maples found in Japan and nearby Korea and China. They are a popular choice for bonsai[7] enthusiasts and have long been a subject in art.</div>

<div>Numerous cultivars are currently available commercially and are a popular item at garden centres and other retail stores in Europe and North America. Red-leafed cultivars are the most popular, followed by cascading green shrubs with deeply dissected leaves.[3]</div>

<div>Preparations from the branches and leaves are used as a treatment in traditional Chinese medicine.[8]</div>
